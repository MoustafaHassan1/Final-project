# Yes or No

#### Video Demo: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlxJB4qdkpk>

#### Description: this is a choose your own adventure type of game made in flask you are only given the choice to say yes or no and the game has multiple endings some of which are unexpected deaths and some are happy endings. the requirements are very minimal being Flask and Flask-Session. I used bootstrap for styling as it was a very convenient way to structure the HTML layout and give a slick and responsive feel. for the templates, I used only 5 files a layout on which to base the others on, an index file that has the main game screen, a new_hero file that's used to start the game or continue where you left off, an ending file to display any ending the player may have gotten and an apology file that's the same as CS50 pset9 finance. the static folder contains three icons taken from <https://icon-icons.com/icon/mar-dragon/38125>, <https://icon-icons.com/icon/coin-dollar-finance/125510> and <https://icon-icons.com/icon/game-steal-sword-tools-weapon/112708>. for the app.py file I also took two functions from finance which are login_required and apology the rest is all my work. I made this project in flask for the ease of making multiple pages from a template and relative flexibility. this project was made as a final project for CS50 2022 and I made it a choose your own adventure game because I enjoy those types of games. I debated using a SQLite database for this project but found it unnecessary because the game is so short I had also made a js file and a CSS file at the beginning but found them unnecessary. I had also thought of using just Js CSS and HTML for this project but ended up at the end with flask because I am more familiar with it.
